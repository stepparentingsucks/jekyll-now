# 5 reasons step parenting sucks.
1. The ex wife, AKA the mom you will never be. 
2. The indifference that the step child feels towards me. I come in a distant third in my step daughter's world. Mom and dad at the top and me somewhere below them, around the level of the family pets I think. In our house I buy all of her clothes, do all of her laundry, buy all of her favorite foods and then pack them into her lunch every day. Now I know that doesn't make me parent of the year. It simply makes me a parent. These are the things parents do to take care of their kids right?  I just want 5 seconds of acknowledgement.  I want her to realize that I try really hard to keep her world running smoothly and that if we left it up to her dad she would subsist on PBJ (which she hates by the way because I have her favorite foods memorized!)
3. The sibling rivalry. I want to take my son's side in every argument they have. I don't. But I really want to. I see his faults. They just don't seem as annoying as his step sister's. My attempts to maintain a fair and equal household drive me to open a second bottle of wine.
